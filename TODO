- this code probably needs to go in ~/go/src/github.com/code-ready/crc-driver-hyperkit
- I used the same hyperkit binary as the one from crc_hyperkit.sh, the one from
  brew was not working
- I used the libvirt 4.1.0 image + manually extracted kernel/vmlinuz
- it needs changes in crc too: https://github.com/cfergeau/crc/tree/hyperkit


things which are not done yet:

- get rid of the hardcoded values in this commit
- detecting hyperkit startup failures is non-existent (eg if crc.pid exists,
  hyperkit fails to start but crc thinks everything is fine - even the code to
  detect if hyperkit is running is flakey ??
- crc stop is not working (mostly untested)
- crc needs to download hyperkit + crc-machine-driver
- VM IP was not added to resolv.conf, but this might be my crc code which is
  outdated (it definitely is not latest master)
- the vendor'ed hyperkit code seems old, maybe update this
